# 2. Statistics
##Built-in support for statistics
- R is a statistical programming language:
    + Classical statistical tests are built-in
    + Statistical modeling functions are built-in
    + Regression analysis is fully supported
    + Additional mathematical packages are available (`MASS`, Waves, sparse matrices, etc)
  
##Distribution functions  
- Most commonly used distributions are built-in, functions have stereotypical names, e.g. for normal distribution:
    + **`pnorm`** - cumulative distribution for x
    + **`qnorm`** - inverse of pnorm (from probability gives x)
    + **`dnorm`** - distribution density
    + **`rnorm`** - random number from normal distribution
  
![distributions](images/distributions.png)  
  
- Available for variety of distributions: `punif` (uniform), `pbinom` (binomial), `pnbinom` (negative binomial), `ppois` (poisson), `pgeom` (geometric), `phyper` (hyper-geometric), `pt` (T distribution), pf (F distribution) 


- 10 random values from the Normal distribution with mean 10 and standard deviation 5:
```{r}
rnorm(10, mean=10, sd=5)
```
- The probability of drawing exactly 10 from this distribution:
```{r}
dnorm(10, mean=10, sd=5)
```

```{r}
dnorm(100, mean=10, sd=5)
```


- The probability of drawing a value smaller than 10:
```{r}
pnorm(10, mean=10, sd=5)
```
- The inverse of `pnorm()`:
```{r}
qnorm(0.5, mean=10, sd=5)
```
- How many standard deviations for statistical significance?
```{r}
qnorm(0.95, mean=0, sd=1)
```

## Example

Recall our histogram of Wind Speed from yesterday:

- The data look to be roughly normally-distributed
- An assumption we rely on for various statistical tests

```{r}
weather <- read.csv("ozone.csv")
hist(weather$Wind, col="purple", xlab="Wind Speed",
     main="Distribution of Wind Speed",
     breaks = 20, freq=FALSE)
```

## Create a normal distribution curve

- If our data are normally-distributed, we can calculate the probability of drawing particular values.
      + e.g. a Wind Speed of 10

```{r}
windMean <- mean(weather$Wind)
windSD <- sd(weather$Wind)
dnorm(10, mean=windMean, sd=windSD)
```

- We can overlay this on the histogram using `points` as we just saw:
```{r}
hist(weather$Wind, col="purple", xlab="Wind Speed",
     main="Distribution of Wind Speed",
     breaks = 20, freq=FALSE)
points(10, dnorm(10, mean=windMean, sd=windSD),
       col="red", pch=16)
```

- We can repeat the calculation for a vector of values
    + remember that functions in R are often ***vectorized***
    + use `lines` in this case rather than `points`
    
```{r}
xs <- c(0,5,10,15,20)
ys <- dnorm(xs, mean=windMean, sd=windSD)
hist(weather$Wind, col="purple", xlab="Wind Speed",
     main="Distribution of Wind Speed",
     breaks = 20, freq=FALSE)
lines(xs, ys, col="red")
```




- For a smoother curve, use a longer vector:
    + we can generate x values using the `seq()` function
- Inspecting the data in this manner is usually acceptable to assess normality
    + the fit doesn't have to be exact
    + the shapiro test is also available `?shapiro.test` (but not really recommended by statisticians)


```{r}
hist(weather$Wind,col="purple",xlab="Wind Speed",
     main="Distribution of Wind Speed",breaks = 20,freq=FALSE)
xs <- seq(0,20, length.out = 10000)
ys <- dnorm(xs, mean=windMean,sd=windSD)
lines(xs,ys,col="red")
```

## Simple testing

- If we want to compute the probability of observing a particular Wind Speed, from the same distribution, we can use the standard formula to calculate a t statistic:

$$t = \frac{\bar{x} -\mu_0}{s / \sqrt(n)}$$

- Say a Wind Speed of 2; which from the histogram seems to be unlikely

```{r}
t <- (windMean - 2) / (windSD/sqrt(length(weather$Wind)))
t
```

- ...or use the **`t.test()`** function to compute the statistic and corresponding p-value

```{r}
t.test(weather$Wind, mu=2)
```

- A variety of tests are supported the R authors have tried to make them as consistent as possible

```{r}
?var.test
?t.test
?wilcox.test
?prop.test
?cor.test
?chisq.test
?fisher.test
```

    
- Bottom-line: Pretty much any statistical test you care to name will probably be in R
    + This is not supposed to be a statistics course (sorry!)
    + None of them are particular harder than others to use
    + The difficulty is deciding which test to use:
        + whether the assumptions of the test are met, etc.
    + Consult your local statistician if not sure
    + An upcoming course that will help
        + [Introduction to Statistical Analysis](http://bioinformatics-core-shared-training.github.io/IntroductionToStats/)
    + Some good references:
        + [Statistical Analysis Using R (Course from the Babaraham Bioinformatics Core)](http://training.csx.cam.ac.uk/bioinformatics/event/1827771)
        + [Quick-R guide to stats](http://www.statmethods.net/stats/index.html)

   - R will do whatever you ask it, it will never check the assumptions or help you to interpret the result

## Example analysis

- We have already seen that men in our `patients` dataset tend to be heavier than women
- We can **test this formally** in R
    + N.B. the weight of people in a population tends to be normally distributed, so we can probably be safe to use a parametric test
    
![](images/males-versus-females.png)




We need to run this if we don't have the patients data in our R environment
```{r}
patients <- read.delim("patient-info.txt")
```

We can test if the variance of the two groups is the same

+ this will influence what flavour of t-test we use

```{r}
var.test(patients$Weight~patients$Sex)
```


```{r}
t.test(patients$Weight~patients$Sex, var.equal=FALSE)
```

If were unwilling to make a assumption of normality, a non-parametric test could be used.

```{r}
wilcox.test(patients$Weight~patients$Sex)
```

## Linear Regression

- Linear modeling is supported by the function `lm()`:
    + `example(lm)`
- The output assumes you know a fair bit about the subject
- `lm` is really useful for plotting lines of best fit to XY data, in order to determine intercept, gradient and Pearson's correlation coefficient
    + This is very easy in R
- Three steps to plotting with a best fit line:

    + Plot XY scatter-plot data
    + Fit a linear model
    + Add bestfit line data to plot with `abline()` function
- Let's see a toy example:-

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2.3, 3.1, 4.8, 5.6, 6.3)
y <- c(2.6, 2.8, 3.1, 4.7, 5.1, 5.3)
plot(x,y, xlim=c(0,10), ylim=c(0,10))
```

- The `~` is used to define a formula; i.e. "y is given by x"
    + Take care about the order of `x` and `y` in the `plot` and `lm` expressions

```{r}
plot(x,y, xlim=c(0,10), ylim=c(0,10))
myModel <- lm(y~x)
abline(myModel, col="red")
```

The generic `summary` function give an overview of the model

- particular components are accessible if we know their names

```{r}
summary(myModel)
names(myModel)  # Names of the objects within myModel
```

- alternatively, various helper functions are provided.

```{r}
coef(myModel)   # Coefficients
resid(myModel)  # Residuals
fitted(myModel) # Fitted values
residuals(myModel) + fitted(myModel) # what values does this give?
```

You can also get some diagnostic information on the model.

- Some explanation can be found [here](http://data.library.virginia.edu/diagnostic-plots/) and [here](http://strata.uga.edu/6370/rtips/regressionPlots.html)

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2)) 
plot(myModel)
```

- R has a very powerful formula syntax for describing statistical models
- Suppose we had two explanatory variables `x` and `z`, and one response variable `y`
- We can describe a relationship between, say, `y` and `x` using a tilde `~`, placing the response variable on the left of the tilde and the explanatory variables on the right:
    + y~x
- It is very easy to extend this syntax to do multiple regressions, ANOVAs, to include interactions, and to do many other common modelling tasks. For example

```{r}
y~x       #If x is continuous, this is linear regression
y~x       #If x is categorical, ANOVA
y~x+z     #If x and z are continuous, multiple regression
y~x+z     #If x and z are categorical, two-way ANOVA
y~x+z+x:z # : is the symbol for the interaction term
y~x*z     # * is a shorthand for x+z+x:z
```

## Exercise: Exercise 6

- There are suggestions that Ozone level could be influenced by Temperature:
```{r}
plot(weather$Temp, weather$Ozone,xlab="Temperature",ylab="Ozone level",pch=16)
```

- Perform a linear regression analysis to assess this:
    + Fit the linear model and print a summary of the output
    + Plot the two variables and overlay a best-fit line
    + What is the equation of the best-fit line in the form
      $$ y = ax + b$$
- Calculate the correlation between the two variables using the function cor (?cor)
    + can you add text to the plot to show the correlation coefficient?
    + HINT: The `paste` can be used to join strings of text together, or variables

```{r}
paste("Hello","World")
age <- 35
paste("My age is", age)
```


```{r}
