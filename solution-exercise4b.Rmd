# Scatter plot of solar radiation versus ozone level; points coloured in orange with filled circles

     ylab="Ozone level", xlab="Solar Radiation", 
     main="Relationship between ozone level and 
     solar radiation")

# Histogram of Wind Speed; density on y axis, coloured purple, broken into bins of size 1 unit

```{r}

# Boxplot of Ozone level per-month; different colours for each month

```{r}
