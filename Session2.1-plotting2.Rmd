#1. Further customisation of plots

## Recap

- We have seen how to use `plot()`, `boxplot()` , `hist()` etc to make simple plots
- These come with arguments that can be used to change the appearance of the plot
    + `col`, `pch`
    + `main`, `xlab`, `ylab`
    + etc....
- We will now look at ways to modify the plot appearance after it has been created
- Also, how to export the graphs 



## The painter's model

- R employs a painter's model to construct it's plots
- Elements of the graph are added to the canvas one layer at a time, and the picture built up in levels.
- Lower levels are obscured by higher levels, 
    + allowing for blending, masking and overlaying of objects.
- Caution: You can't undo the changes you make to the plot

## Example data

- We will re-use the patients data from yesterday:

```{r}
source("create-patients-data.R")
```



##Initial plot

- Recall our patients dataset from yesterday
    + we might want to display other characteristics on the plot, e.g. gender of individual:

```{r}
plot(patients$Age, patients$Weight, pch=16)
```

##The points function

- `points()` can be used to set of points to an *existing* plot
- It requires a vector of x and y coordinates
    + These do not have to be the same length as the number of points in the initial plot:
        + Hence we can use `points()` to highlight observations
        + ...or add a set of new observations
```{r }
plot(patients$Age, patients$Weight, pch=16)
points(40,68, pch="X")
```

- Note that axis limits of the existing plot are not altered

## Creating a blank plot

- Often it is useful to create a blank 'canvas' with the correct labels and limits

```{r}
plot(patients$Age, patients$Weight, type="n")
```

## Adding points to differentiate gender

- Selecting males using the **`==`** comparison we saw yesterday
    + Gives a `TRUE` or `FALSE` value
    + Can be used to index the data frame
    + Which means we can get the relevant Age and Weight values
```{r}
males <- patients$Sex == "Male"
males
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
males
patients[males,]
patients$Age[males]
patients$Weight[males]
```

## Adding points to differentiate gender

- The points we add have to be within the `x` and `y` limits of the original plot axes, otherwise they won't be displayed

```{r}
plot(patients$Age, patients$Weight, type="n")
points(patients$Age[males], patients$Weight[males], 
       pch=16, col="steelblue")

```


We can do the same for Females
    
```{r}
females <- patients$Sex == "Female"
females
patients[females,]
```

- Again, we have to be careful that all the points are within the `x` and `y` limits
    + this is why creating the blank plot containing the limits of the data is useful

```{r}
plot(patients$Age, patients$Weight, type="n")
points(patients$Age[males], patients$Weight[males],
       pch=16, col="steelblue")
points(patients$Age[females], patients$Weight[females],
       pch=16, col="orangered1")

```

- Each set of points can have a different colour and shape
- Axis labels and title and limits are defined by the plot
- Once you've added points to a plot, they cannot be removed
- A call to `plot` will start a new graphics window
    - or typing `dev.off()`

```{r }
plot(patients$Age, patients$Weight, type="n")
points(patients$Age[males], patients$Weight[males],
       pch=16, col="steelblue")
points(patients$Age[females], patients$Weight[females], 
       pch=17, col="orangered1")
```




## Adding a legend

- Should also add a legend to help interpret the plot
    + use the `legend` function
    + can give x and y coordinates where legend will appear
    + also recognises shortcuts such as ***topleft*** and ***bottomright***...

```{r}
plot(patients$Age, patients$Weight, type="n")
points(patients$Age[males], patients$Weight[males], 
       pch=16, col="steelblue")
points(patients$Age[females], patients$Weight[females],
       pch=17, col="orangered1")
legend("topleft", legend=c("M","F"), 
       col=c("steelblue","orangered1"), pch=c(16,17))
```

##Adding text

- Text can also be added to a plot in a similar manner
    + The `labels` argument specifies the text we want to add
    
```{r}
plot(patients$Age, patients$Weight, pch=16)
text(patients$Age, patients$Weight, labels=patients$Full_Name)
```

- Can alter the positions so they don't interfere with the points of the graph
    
```{r }
plot(patients$Age, patients$Weight, pch=16,
     xlim=c(10,70), ylim=c(60,75))
text(patients$Age-1, patients$Weight-0.5, 
     labels=patients$Full_Name)
```

- Alternatively, you can use the argument `adj`

## Adding lines

- To aid our interpretation, it is often helpful to add guidelines
    + `grid()` is one easy way of doing this:
    
```{r}
plot(patients$Age, patients$Weight, pch=16)
grid(col="steelblue")
```


- Can also add lines that intersect the axes:
    + `v =` for vertical lines
    + `h =` for horizontal
    + can specify multiple lines in a vector
    
```{r}
plot(patients$Age, patients$Weight, pch=16)
abline(v=40, col="red")
abline(h=c(65,70,75), col="blue")
```


## Plot layouts

- The `par` function can be used specify the appearance of a plot
- The settings persist until the plot is closed with **`dev.off()`**
- `?par` and scroll to ***graphical parameters***
- One example is `mfrow`:
    + "multiple figures per row"
    + needs to be a vector of rows and columns:
        + e.g. a plot with one row and two columns `par(mfrow=c(1,2))`
        + don't need the same kind of plot in each cell
        
## Plot layouts    
    
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(patients$Age, patients$Weight, pch=16,
     xlim=c(10,70), ylim=c(60,75))
boxplot(patients$Weight ~ patients$Sex)

```

- See also `mar` for setting the margins:
    + `par(mar=c(...))`
    
## Exporting graphs from RStudio

- When using Rstudio interactively, the easiest option is to use the *Export* button from the *Plots* panel
- Otherwise, in an R script you can use the `pdf()` function:
    + You will see that the plot does not appear in RStudio
- You need to use the `dev.off()` to stop printing graphs to the pdf and 'close' the file
    + It allows you to create a pdf document with multiple pages
    
```{r}
pdf("ExampleGraph.pdf")
plot(rnorm(1:10))
dev.off()
```

- pdf is a good choice for publication as they can be imported into Photoshop, Inkscape, etc.
    - Sometimes it is easier to edit in these tools than R!
    - If it is taking too long to customise a plot in R, consider if you should be using one of these tools instead
    

- To save any graph you have created to a pdf, repeat the code you used to create the plot with `pdf()` before and `dev.off()` afterwards
    + you can have as many lines of code in-between as you like
    
```{r}
pdf("mygraph.pdf")
plot(patients$Age, patients$Weight, pch=16)
abline(v=40, col="red")
abline(h=c(65,70,75), col="blue")
dev.off()
```

- If no plots are appearing in RStudio, it could be you are still writing to a pdf file
    + run `dev.off()` multiple times until you see a message `cannot shut down device (the null device)`


- We can specify the dimensions of the plot, and other properties of the file (`?pdf`)

```{r}
pdf("ExampleGraph.pdf", width=10, height=10)
plot(rnorm(1:10))
dev.off()
```

- Other formats can be created:
    + e.g. ***png***, or others `?jpeg`
    + more appropriate for email, presentations, web page
    
```{r}
png("ExampleGraph.png")
plot(rnorm(1:10))
dev.off()
```

##Exercise: Exercise 5a
- Return to the weather data from yesterday:

```{r}
weather <- read.csv("ozone.csv")
```

- Using the `par` function, create a layout with three columns
- Plot Ozone versus Solar Radiation, Wind Speed and Temperature on separate graphs
    + use different colours and plotting characters on each plot
- Save the plot to a pdf
- HINT: Create the graph first in RStudio. When you're happy with it, re-run the code preceeded by the `pdf` function to save to a file
    + don't forget to use `dev.off()` to close the file

```


##Exercise: Exercise 5b
- Temperature and Ozone level seem to be correlated
- However, there are some observations that do not seem to fit the trend
    + those with Ozone level > 100
- Modify the plot so that these outlier observations are in a different colour


![](images/exercise5b.png)


HINT: You can break down the problem into the following steps

- Create a blank plot
- Identify observations with ozone > 100
    + plot the corresponding Temperature and Ozone values for these in red
- Identify observations with ozone < 100
    + plot the corresponding Temperature and Ozone values for these in orange


```{r}
