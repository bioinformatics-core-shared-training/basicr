# 3. R for data analysis

##3 steps to Basic Data Analysis

- In this short section, we show how the data manipulation steps we have just seen can be used as part of an analysis pipeline:

1. Reading in data
    + `read.table()`
    + `read.csv(), read.delim()`
2. Analysis
    + Manipulating & reshaping the data
    + Any maths you like
    + Plotting the outcome
3. Writing out results
    + `write.table()`
    + `write.csv()`
  
##A simple walkthrough

- 50 neuroblastoma patients were tested for NMYC gene copy number by interphase nuclei FISH:
      + Amplification of NMYC correlates with worse prognosis
      + We have count data
      + Numbers of cells per patient assayed
          + For each we have NMYC copy number relative to base ploidy
- We need to determine which patients have amplifications
    + (i.e > 33% of cells show NMYC amplification)
    
##The Working Directory (wd)


- Like many programs R has a concept of a working directory 
- It is the place where R will look for files to execute and where it will
save files, by default
- For this course we need to set the working directory to the location
of the course scripts
- In RStudio use the mouse and browse to the directory where you saved the Course Materials

- ***Session → Set Working Directory → Choose Directory...***

## 0. Locate the data

Before we even start the analysis, we need to be sure of where the data are located on our hard drive

- Functions that import data need a file location as a character vector
- The default location is the ***working directory***
```{r}
getwd()
```

- If the file you want to read is in your working directory, you can just use the file name
```{r}
list.files()
```

- Otherwise you need the *path* to the file
    + you can get this using **`file.choose()`**
    
##1. Read in the data

- The data is a tab-delimited file. Each row is a record, each column is a field. Columns are separated by tabs in the text
- We need to read in the results and assign it to an object (`rawdata`)

```{r}
rawData <- read.delim("countData.txt")
```

In the latest RStudio, there is the option to import data directly from the File menu. ***File*** -> ***Import Dataset*** -> ***From Csv***

- If the data is comma-separated, then use either the argument `sep=","` or the function `read.csv()`:
```{r}
read.csv("countData.csv")
```
- For full list of arguments:
```{r}
?read.table
```

##1b. Check the data
- *Always* check the object to make sure the contents and dimensions are as you expect
- R will sometimes create the object without error, but the contents may be un-usable for analysis
    + If you specify an incorrect separator, R will not be able to locate the columns in your data, and you may end up with an object with just one column
    
```{r}
# View the first 10 rows to ensure import is OK
rawData[1:10,]  
```


- or use the `View()` function to get a display of the data in RStudio:
```{r}
View(rawData)
```

##1c. Understanding the object

- Once we have read the data successfully, we can start to interact with it
- The object we have created is a *data frame*:
```{r}
class(rawData)
```

- We can query the dimensions:

```{r}
ncol(rawData)
nrow(rawData)
dim(rawData)
```

- Or the structure of an object:
     + TIP: In RStudio, window *Environment*, click the blue arrow in the left of an object's name, in order to see the object structure
```{r}
str(rawData)
```

##1c. Understanding the object

- The names of the columns are automatically assigned:

```{r}
colnames(rawData)
```

- We can use any of these names to access a particular column:
    + and create a vector
    + TOP TIP: type the name of the object and hit TAB: you can select the column from the drop-down list!
```{r}
rawData$Nuclei
```

##Word of caution

> Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way - (Hadley Wickham - RStudio chief scientist and author of dplyr, ggplot2 and others)

##Word of caution

You will make your life a lot easier if you keep your data **tidy** and ***organised***. Before blaming R, consider if your data are in a suitable form for analysis. The more manual manipulation you have done on the data (highlighting, formulas, copy-and-pasting), the less happy R is going to be to read it. Here are some useful links on some common pitfalls and how to avoid them

- http://kbroman.org/dataorg/

##Handling missing values

- The data frame contains some **`NA`** values, which means the values are missing – a common occurrence in real data collection
- `NA` is a special value that can be present in objects of any type (logical, character, numeric etc)
- `NA` is not the same as `NULL`:
    - `NULL` is an empty R object. 
    - `NA` is one missing value within an R object (like a data frame or a vector)
- Often R functions will handle `NA`s gracefully:

```{r}
x <- c(1, NA, 3)
length(x)
```

##Handling missing values

- However, sometimes we have to tell the functions what to do with them. 
- R has some built-in functions for dealing with `NA`s, and functions often have their own arguments (like `na.rm`) for handling them:


```{r}
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)

mean(na.omit(x))
```

##2. Analysis (reshaping data and maths)

- Our analysis involves identifying patients with > 33% NB amplification
    + we can use the **`which()`** function to select indices from a logical vector that are `TRUE`
    
```{r}
# Create an index of results:
prop <- rawData$NB_Amp / rawData$Nuclei

```

```{r}
prop > 0.33
```

```{r}
amp <- which(prop > 0.33) 
amp
```


##2. Analysis (reshaping data and maths)

- We can plot a simple chart of the % NB amplification
    + Note that two samples are amplified
    + Plotting will be covered in detail shortly

```{r}
plot(prop, ylim=c(0,1))
# Add a horizonal line:
abline(h=0.33) 
```

- It is also useful to save the variable we have computed as a new column in the data frame

```{r}
round(prop,2)
rawData$Proportion <- round(prop,2)
head(rawData)
```


##3. Outputting the results

- We write out a data frame of results (patients > 33% NB amplification) as a 'comma separated values' text file (CSV):
```{r}
write.csv(rawData[amp,], file="selectedSamples.csv")
```
- The output file is directly-readable by Excel
- It's often helpful to double check where the data has been saved. Use the *get working directory* function:

```{r}
getwd()      # print working directory
list.files() # list files in working directory

```

##Exercise: Exercise 3

- Patients are *near normal* if:
`(NB_Amp / Nuclei < 0.33 & NB_Del == 0)`
- Modify the condition in our previous code to find these patients
- Write out a results file of the samples that match these criteria, and open it in a spreadsheet program


```{r}
