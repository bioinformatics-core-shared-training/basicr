# 2. Statistics
##Built-in support for statistics
- R is a statistical programming language:
    + Classical statistical tests are built-in
    + Statistical modeling functions are built-in
    + Regression analysis is fully supported
    + Additional mathematical packages are available (`MASS`, Waves, sparse matrices, etc)
  
##Distribution functions  
- Most commonly used distributions are built-in, functions have stereotypical names, e.g. for normal distribution:
    + **`pnorm`** - cumulative distribution for x
    + **`qnorm`** - inverse of pnorm (from probability gives x)
    + **`dnorm`** - distribution density
    + **`rnorm`** - random number from normal distribution
  
![distributions](images/distributions.png)  
  
- Available for variety of distributions: `punif` (uniform), `pbinom` (binomial), `pnbinom` (negative binomial), `ppois` (poisson), `pgeom` (geometric), `phyper` (hyper-geometric), `pt` (T distribution), pf (F distribution) 

##Distribution functions 
- 10 random values from the Normal distribution with mean 10 and standard deviation 5:
```{r eval=FALSE}
rnorm(10, mean=10, sd=5)
```
- The probability of drawing exactly 10 from this distribution:
```{r}
dnorm(10, mean=10, sd=5)
```

```{r}
dnorm(100, mean=10, sd=5)
```

##Distribution functions (continued)

- The probability of drawing a value smaller than 10:
```{r}
pnorm(10, mean=10, sd=5)
```
- The inverse of `pnorm()`:
```{r}
qnorm(0.5, mean=10, sd=5)
```
- How many standard deviations for statistical significance?
```{r}
qnorm(0.95, mean=0, sd=1)
```

## Example

Recall our histogram of Wind Speed from yesterday:

- The data look to be roughly normally-distributed
- An assumption we rely on for various statistical tests

```{r fig.height=4}
weather <- read.csv("ozone.csv")
hist(weather$Wind, col="purple", xlab="Wind Speed",
     main="Distribution of Wind Speed",
     breaks = 20, freq=FALSE)
```

## Create a normal distribution curve

- If our data are normally-distributed, we can calculate the probability of drawing particular values.
      + e.g. a Wind Speed of 10

```{r}
tempMean <- mean(weather$Wind)
tempSD <- sd(weather$Wind)
dnorm(10, mean=tempMean, sd=tempSD)
```

- We can overlay this on the histogram using `points` as we just saw:
```{r fig.height=4}
hist(weather$Wind, col="purple", xlab="Wind Speed",
     main="Distribution of Wind Speed",
     breaks = 20, freq=FALSE)
points(10, dnorm(10, mean=tempMean, sd=tempSD),
       col="red", pch=16)
```


## Create a normal distribution curve

- We can repeat the calculation for a vector of values
    + remember that functions in R are often ***vectorized***
    + use `lines` in this case rather than `points`
    
    ```{r eval=FALSE}
xs <- c(0,5,10,15,20)
ys <- dnorm(xs, mean=tempMean, sd=tempSD)
lines(xs, ys, col="red")
```

```{r fig.height=4,echo=FALSE}
hist(weather$Wind,col="purple",xlab="Wind Speed",
     main="Distribution of Wind Speed",breaks = 20,freq=FALSE)
xs <- c(0,5,10,15,20)
ys <- dnorm(xs, mean=tempMean,sd=tempSD)
lines(xs,ys,col="red")
```

## Create a normal distribution curve

- For a smoother curve, use a longer vector:
    + we can generate x values using the `seq()` function
- Inspecting the data in this manner is usually acceptable to assess normality
    + the fit doesn't have to be exact
    + the shapiro test is also available `?shapiro.test`

```{r eval=FALSE}
xs <- seq(00,20, length.out = 10000)
ys <- dnorm(xs, mean=tempMean, sd=tempSD)
lines(xs, ys, col="red")
```

```{r fig.height=4,echo=FALSE}
hist(weather$Wind,col="purple",xlab="Wind Speed",
     main="Distribution of Wind Speed",breaks = 20,freq=FALSE)
xs <- seq(00,20, length.out = 10000)
ys <- dnorm(xs, mean=tempMean,sd=tempSD)
lines(xs,ys,col="red")
```

## Simple testing

- If we want to compute the probability of observing a particular Wind Speed, from the same distribution, we can use the standard formula to calculate a t statistic:

$$t = \frac{\bar{x} -\mu_0}{s / \sqrt(n)}$$

- Say a Wind Speed of 2; which from the histogram seems to be unlikely

```{r}
t <- (tempMean - 2) / (tempSD/sqrt(length(weather$Wind)))
t
```

## Simple testing

- ...or use the **`t.test()`** function to compute the statistic and corresponding p-value

```{r}
t.test(weather$Wind, mu=2)
```


##Two-sample tests: Basic data analysis

- Comparing 2 variances:
    + Fisher's F test
```{r eval=FALSE}
var.test()
```
- Comparing 2 sample means with normal errors:
    + Student's t test
```{r eval=FALSE}
t.test()
```
- Comparing 2 means with non-normal errors:
    + Wilcoxon's rank test
```{r eval=FALSE}
wilcox.test()
```

##Two-sample tests: Basic data analysis
- Comparing 2 proportions:
    + Binomial test
    + e.g. [here](http://www.r-tutor.com/elementary-statistics/inference-about-two-populations/comparison-two-population-proportions)
    
```{r eval=FALSE}
prop.test()
```
- Correlating 2 variables:
    + Pearson's / Spearman's rank correlation
```{r eval=FALSE}
cor.test()
```
- Testing for independence of 2 variables in a contingency table:
    + Chi-squared / Fisher's exact test
```{r eval=FALSE}
chisq.test(); fisher.test()
```

## Statistical tests in R

- Bottom-line: Pretty much any statistical test you care to name will probably be in R
    + This is not supposed to be a statistics course (sorry!)
    + None of them are particular harder than others to use
    + The difficulty is deciding which test to use:
        + whether the assumptions of the test are met, etc.
    + Consult your local statistician if not sure
    + An upcoming course that will help
        + [Introduction to Statistical Analysis](http://bioinformatics-core-shared-training.github.io/IntroductionToStats/)

## Example analysis

- We have already seen that men in our `patients` dataset tend to be heavier than women
- We can **test this formally** in R

![](images/males-versus-females.png)

  
## Test variance assumption

```{r}
var.test(patients$Weight~patients$Sex)
```

## Perform the t-test

```{r}
t.test(patients$Weight~patients$Sex, var.equal=TRUE)
```

- This function can be tuned in various ways (`?t.test`):
    - Assumed equal variances, or not (and use Welch's correction)
    - Deal with paired samples
    - Two-sided, or one-sided p-value

##Linear regression: Basic data analysis

- Linear modeling is supported by the function **`lm()`**:
    + `example(lm)` 
    + The output assumes you know a fair bit about the subject

- `lm` is really useful for plotting lines of best fit to XY data, in order to determine intercept, gradient and Pearson's correlation coefficient
    + This is very easy in R

- Three steps to plotting with a best fit line:
    1. Plot XY scatter-plot data
    2. Fit a linear model
    3. Add bestfit line data to plot with `abline()` function
  
##Typical linear regression analysis: Basic data analysis

-  The ~ (***tilde***) is used to define a ***formula***; i.e. "y is given by x"

 
```{r fig.height=5}
x <- c(1, 2.3, 3.1, 4.8, 5.6, 6.3)
y <- c(2.6, 2.8, 3.1, 4.7, 5.1, 5.3)
plot(x,y, xlim=c(0,10), ylim=c(0,10))
```


##Typical linear regression analysis: Basic data analysis

 The ~ is used to define a formula; i.e. "y is given by x"
- Take care about the order of x and y in the plot and lm expressions

```{r,fig.height=5}
plot(x,y, xlim=c(0,10), ylim=c(0,10))
myModel <- lm(y~x)
abline(myModel, col="red")
```

## In-depth summary

```{r}
summary(myModel)
```


##Typical linear regression analysis: Basic data analysis
- Get the coefficients of the fit from:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
coef(myModel)   # Coefficients
resid(myModel)  # Residuals
fitted(myModel) # Fitted values
names(myModel)  # Names of the objects within myModel
residuals(myModel) + fitted(myModel) # what values does this give?
```

## Diagnostic plots of the fit

- Get QC of fit from:
    + Some explanation is given [here](http://data.library.virginia.edu/diagnostic-plots/) and [here](http://strata.uga.edu/6370/rtips/regressionPlots.html)
    
```{r,fig.height=5}
par(mfrow=c(2,2)) 
plot(myModel)
```

##Modelling formulae
- R has a very powerful formula syntax for describing statistical models
- Suppose we had two explanatory variables `x` and `z`, and one response
variable `y`
- We can describe a relationship between, say, `y` and `x` using a tilde `~`,
placing the response variable on the left of the tilde and the explanatory variables on the right:
    + `y~x`
- It is very easy to extend this syntax to do multiple regressions, ANOVAs, to include interactions, and to do many other common modelling tasks. For example
```{r eval=FALSE}
y~x       #If x is continuous, this is linear regression
y~x       #If x is categorical, ANOVA
y~x+z     #If x and z are continuous, multiple regression
y~x+z     #If x and z are categorical, two-way ANOVA
y~x+z+x:z # : is the symbol for the interaction term
y~x*z     # * is a shorthand for x+z+x:z
```


## Exercise: Exercise 6

- There are suggestions that Ozone level could be influenced by Temperature:

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.height=4}
plot(weather$Temp, weather$Ozone,xlab="Temperature",ylab="Ozone level",pch=16)
```

- Perform a linear regression analysis to assess this:
    + Fit the linear model and print a summary of the output
    + Plot the two variables and overlay a best-fit line
    + What is the equation of the best-fit line in the form
        + $$ y = mx + c$$
    + Calculate the correlation between the two variables using the function `cor` (`?cor`)
        + can you annotate the plot with the correlation coefficient?
    

## Word of caution

***Correlation != Causation***
